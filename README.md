This project was my individual final assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course involved creating a classic Pac-Man game using Processing. 

Key features includes: grid-based map, collision detection, score tracking, and game state management. 

I also integrated sound effects for background music, coin collection, and game outcomes, showcasing my skills in OOP, multimedia integration, and interactive game development.
